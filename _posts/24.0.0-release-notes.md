After one eventful year of development, the long awaited **v24.0.0** has just been released! This major update introduces new features, aesthetic standards, **Health** and **Career** modules overhaul, as well as stability upgrades and other quality-of-life changes.

_As we are still waiting for [NAB Innovation Centre] to approve our collaboration proposal, we will have mid-patch updates before going on break for the Tet Holiday._

Thanks for supporting us on this journey, and we look forward to seeing you in 2023!
