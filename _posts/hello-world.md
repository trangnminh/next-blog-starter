Hello world, from a white ceiling!

Today, the **next-blog-starter** website is deployed for the first time, taking far longer than I would've wanted (this is a carbon copy of the example project, after all). I may or may not continue to work on it, but I'll try my best to be persistent.

Then, maybe we can get out of Facebook hell for real.
